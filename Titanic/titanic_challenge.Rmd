Titanic Kaggle:

Load Libraries
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```



Load Data
```{r}
titanic_train = read.csv('~/code/Kaggle-Challenges/Titanic/train.csv')
titanic_test = read.csv('~/code/Kaggle-Challenges/Titanic/test.csv')

str(titanic_train) 
#PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
str(titanic_test)

table(titanic_train$Survived, useNA = "ifany")
```

Clean and Visualize data
```{r}
#remove data which is individual to each passanger: PassengerId, Ticket, names for now although this may be used to create relationships
train_clean = titanic_train[,!(names(titanic_train) %in% c("PassengerId", "Name", "Ticket"))]
train_clean$Age = factor(ifelse(train_clean$Age < 18, 'child', 'adult'))
str(train_clean)


rand_ids = order(runif(891))
train = train_clean[rand_ids[1:691],]
test = train_clean[rand_ids[692:891],]


pairs(train, gap = 0, cex.labels = 0.9)

ggplot(aes(x = Sex, y = Survived), data = train_clean) + geom_jitter(alpha= 1, size = 1) + theme_minimal()
#there is a striking affect of sex (females survive more than males)
ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Sex, colour = Survived), data = train_clean) + geom_jitter(alpha= 1, size = 1)
#the effect of age isn't terribly obvious, maybe try splitting into groups
ggplot(aes(x = Age), data= train_clean) + geom_histogram()
#split 0-18, 18-40, 40+ ?

ggplot(aes(x = Pclass, y = Survived), data = train_clean) + geom_jitter(alpha= 1, size = 1)
#3rd class passangers survived less

ggplot(aes(x = SibSp, y = Survived), data = train_clean) + geom_jitter(alpha= 1, size = 1)
#no clear trend, maybe with family tree intact

ggplot(aes(x = Parch, y = Survived), data = train_clean) + geom_jitter(alpha= 1, size = 1)
#no clear trend, maybe with family tree intact or conditioning on age

ggplot(aes(x = Fare, y = Survived), data = train_clean) + geom_jitter(alpha= 1, size = 1)
#people with cheap fares didn't surviv but this could also be realted to Pclass?

ggplot(aes(x = Cabin, y = Survived), data = train_clean) + geom_jitter(alpha= 1, size = 1)
#no obvious affect, but may need more info

ggplot(aes(x = Embarked, y = Survived), data = train_clean) + geom_jitter(alpha= 1, size = 1)
#no clear trend


ggplot(aes(x = Sex, y = Survived), data = train_clean) + geom_jitter(alpha= 1, size = 1) + theme_minimal()
```

Run logistic regression
```{r}
titanic_1 = glm(data = train_clean, Survived ~ Sex + Age + Pclass, family = binomial("logit"))

summary(titanic_1)

predict(titanic_1, test)
```
